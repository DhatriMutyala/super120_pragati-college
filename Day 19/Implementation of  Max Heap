# Implementation of  Max Heap
# consider every value as minus sign then
# the largest number with minus sign will be small here
# so that we can get max heap

print(arr)
heapq.heapify(arr) # making heap structure
print(arr)

print(arr)
print(-heapq.heappop(arr)) # keep '-' for popped val
print(arr)
print(heapq.nsmallest(3,arr))#n is 3 so 3 top smallest in queue
